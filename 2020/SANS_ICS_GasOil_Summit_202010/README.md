## Title

Detecting Encrypted Radio Communications Using Universal Hacker Radio

## Abstract

<img align="right" src="https://www.cutawaysecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/logo.png" /> Radio communications are used to establish communications without the need for wired connections. They also provide a degree of safety to personnel supporting dangerous processes. These benefits come with additional risk. Radio communications are externally accessible, meaning that they expose their networks to the public. This presentation will demonstrate how to capture radio communications of 900 MHz radios that are commonly deployed in operational technology (OT) environments. The tool Universal Radio Hacker (URH) will be used to quickly isolate the radio communications, transform those transmissions to data packets, and review the packets for encryption.
